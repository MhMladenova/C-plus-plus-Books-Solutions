/*
	A year with 366 days is called a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four
	(for example, 1980), except that it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 (for
	example, 1900); however, it is a leap year if it is divisible by 400 (for example, 2000).
	There were no exceptions before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar on
	October 15, 1582 (1500 was a leap year). Write a program that asks the user for a year
	and computes whether that year is a leap year
