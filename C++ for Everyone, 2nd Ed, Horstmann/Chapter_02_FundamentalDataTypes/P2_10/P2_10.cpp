/*
Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your
pro gram’s inputs should be:
• The cost of a new car
• The estimated miles driven per year
• The estimated gas price
• The estimated resale value after 5 years
Compute the total cost of owning the car
for 5 years. (For simplic ity, we will not take
the cost of financing into account.) Obtain
realistic prices for a new and used hybrid and
a comparable car from the Web. Run your
program twice, using today’s gas price and 15,000 miles per year. Include pseudocode
and the program runs with your assignment.
